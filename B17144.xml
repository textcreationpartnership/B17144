            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER To LOVES THE CAUSE OF MY MOURNING,</head>
            <opener>Sung with its own proper Tune:</opener>
            <lg>
               <l>WHen first my poor heart unacquainted to love,</l>
               <l>The god with his bow and his arrow did prove</l>
               <l>So soft was the warmth it so gently did move,</l>
               <l>As yet the green wound was not bleeding.</l>
               <l>I knew not what ail'd me, but something I found</l>
               <l>I never felt before, which the more did abound</l>
               <l>As <hi>Straphon</hi> I thought on and walk't over the ground</l>
               <l>Where his milkie white flock he was feeding.</l>
               <l>But now alas, it doth increase to fatal loves excess,</l>
               <l>Never was poor Shepherdess so qite undone</l>
               <l>Yet though it should kill me I never will express</l>
               <l>To <hi>Straphon</hi> the cause of my thraldome.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Straphon</hi> the brave, the Witty, and Gay,</l>
               <l>So fine were the Notes he so sweetly did play,</l>
               <l>That he charmed the whole Nimphs of the plain in the day</l>
               <l>But all night he keeps my Heart burning</l>
               <l>How cruels the custom forbids to reveal</l>
               <l>A passion so strong, so hard to conceal,</l>
               <l>To the desart I'le go and the plain bid farewell</l>
               <l>For Love is the cause of my mourning.</l>
               <l>There the sweet Nightingal in mournful notes shall knell</l>
               <l>My lovesome funeral as she is flying.</l>
               <l>Till the Rocks shall resound, and <hi>Straphon</hi> tell,</l>
               <l>The sad account of my dying.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when the birds voice disturbed <hi>Straphons</hi> rest</l>
               <l>With the dismall account of <hi>Beatie</hi> the best</l>
               <l>For pity the love peirced his generous breast,</l>
               <l>That ranged the whole forrest to find her.</l>
               <l>And by a murmuring brook as he past,</l>
               <l>Just ready to dye he found her at last:</l>
               <l>In passion with ardour his mind he exprest,</l>
               <l>At length for to hear he inclin'd her.</l>
               <l>Then tenderly by degrees, begging upon his knees</l>
               <l>She his heart would appease, gently replying,</l>
               <l>Is this my dear <hi>Straphon</hi> she straight was at ease.</l>
               <l>So the Shepherd sav'd her from dying.</l>
